            <p>This month's banner features a pecan pie I ate on Thanksgiving.</p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>November 2019 is the 39th month in which I have tracked my productivity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness: <strong>20.25</strong> hours</li> 
                <li>Software Development: <strong>46.25</strong> hours</li>
				<li>Music/Art: <strong>0.00</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Other: <strong>1.25</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Total productive hours: <strong>67.75</strong> hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My average amount of productive hours per day (from all categories) was <strong>2.26</strong> hours. I was a bit lazier toward the end of the month than I would like 
               to admit, but overall my logged hours don't look too bad. For the record, I did take about a week off for Thanksgiving.</p>

			
            <h2>Software Development</h2>
			<p>For the first half of the month, I continued to explore OpenGL and C++ by first finishing HW3 of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics">UCSD 167 (available on edx)</a> and then by working through tutorials on 
               <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">opengl-tutorial.org</a>. 
               While I did originally plan to start working on some sort of project (like an app or game), I actually went in a totally different direction. Starting around the 
               middle of November, I switched my focus to data structure and algorithm problem solving (or DS&A for short). For those that don’t know, many (perhaps most) 
               interviews for software engineering positions require the interviewee to prove their skills by solving problems on a whiteboard. Of course, there is value in and of
               itself in learning to solve these types of problems, but I’d be lying if I said my main motivation here is not to prepare for grueling interviews. Either way, 
               that’s what I’ve decided to focus on until the Spring semester starts in January.</p>

            <p>For the time being, I am reading through <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> and working through the problems in the book. Once I have worked every problem in the book, 
               I will move on to LeetCode. LeetCode seems to be the most popular website for practicing these types of problems.</p>
						
			<p> So how soon am I planning to get a job anyways? Well, I’m not exactly sure. I’m thinking I would like to start working as a software developer by summer of 2020. 
                I am leaning toward applying mostly to internship positions since my main goal is just to keep growing and learning. An internship would also give me the option 
                of working for a few months then going back to school full time.</p>
			
            <p>In other news, I officially put in my notice of resignation from my current position. It’s hard to imagine going back to being an unemployed student. It’s a big 
               change. I know that I need to be careful, so I developed this tentative schedule for myself. As long as I stick to this schedule, I will know I am being productive
               and can feel good about my decision to leave work. Note that I have left Saturday and Sunday unscheduled for the time being. I do plan to do some work on these days, 
               but I will leave the days unstructured for my own sanity. Also, it should go without saying that this schedule is subject to change.</p>

            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <p>In November 2019, my overall fitness hours totalled to <strong>20.25</strong> hours. I spent <strong>11.25</strong> hours lifting weights, and I spent <strong>9.00</strong> hours on cardio. 
			 My average lifting hours per week was <strong>2.63</strong> hours, and my average cardio hours per week was <strong>2.10</strong> hours.</p>
			
			<p>I let myself go a bit during the Thanksgiving break. Fortunately, it never takes long to bounce back.<p>	

			<h2>Music/Art</h2>
			<p>Nothing to see here.</p>
			 	
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>In this past month, I spent <strong>1.25</strong> hours doing other productive stuff.</p>
				
            <h2>Goals for next month (December 2019):</h2>
            <h3>Software Dev Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>work through problems in Cracking the Coding Interview</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fitness Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>Exercise hard. Don't skip workouts.</li>
