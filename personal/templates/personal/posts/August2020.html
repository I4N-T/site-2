            <p>This month's banner features my first pair of boxing gloves.</p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Overall hours are just a bit low for my taste, but that's mostly due to the 5 days in a row I took off prior to the beginning of the semester.</p>

			<p>August 2020 is the 48th month in which I have tracked my productivity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness: <strong>42.25</strong> hours</li> 
                <li>Software Development: <strong>94.00</strong> hours</li>
				<li>Music/Art: <strong>0.00</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Other: <strong>3.25</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Total productive hours: <strong>139.50</strong> hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My average amount of productive hours per day (from all categories) was <strong>4.50</strong> hours.</p>

			
            <h2>Software Development</h2>

            <p>As stated in last month's blog, My focus in the first half of August (before the fall semester began) was practicing Android development by building a minimalist social media app.
            Unfortunately, I did not wrap the project up in time before the semester started, but I did make good progress. I hope to pick back up on this project as soon as I can, but I can already 
            tell that I'm going to be very busy with school throughout this next semester. Perhaps my workload from class will slow down at some point, and I will have some quality time to work on it.</p> 

			<p>The Fall 2020 semester officially began on August 17. I am taking <a href="https://omscentral.com/course/CS-6290">High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)</a> and <a href="https://omscentral.com/course/CS-6310">Software Architecture and Design (SAD)</a>.
            So far, I am enjoying both classes very much. HPCA has a heavy workload, and the material is very difficult to understand. For those reasons, it also is shaping up to be a very rewarding experience. SAD is a bit of a lighter 
            workload; however, the material is highly relevant to software development, which is what I like to do. I guess there isn't really much to say about either course at this point. As usual, I will continue 
            to update each month with more specifics on what I've been working on.</p>
						       			
            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <p>In August 2020, my overall fitness hours totalled to <strong>42.25</strong> hours. I spent <strong>14.25</strong> hours lifting weights (and doing calisthenics), and I spent <strong>15.75</strong> hours on cardio. 
			 My average lifting hours per week was <strong>3.22</strong> hours, and my average cardio hours per week was <strong>3.56</strong> hours.</p>

            <p>On August 3, I had my first boxing lesson. In total, during August I spent 12.25 hours learning and/or practicing boxing. Basically, that's three 1-hour long classes each week plus some additional solo practice at home.
            Note that I am not double counting any hours here. I've chosen to log boxing hours as it's own category separate from cardio.</p>

            <p>Beginning September 1, I plan to start going back to the gym for weight lifting. I will wear a mask and do my best to maintain distance from others. I also will be going to the gym in the middle of 
            the day when it typically is not very busy. Lifting weights is simply too important to neglect any longer. While I was able to maintain a decent amount of muscle with calisthenics these past few months, calisthenics 
            alone really are no replacement for weight lifting.</p>

			<h2>Music/Art</h2>
			<p>NULL</p>
			 	
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>In this past month, I spent <strong>3.25</strong> hours doing other productive stuff.</p>
				
            <h2>Goals for next month (September 2020):</h2>
            <h3>Software Dev Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>Work hard in school, and learn stuff about computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fitness Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>Exercise every day.</li>
            </ul>
			<h3>Other Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>null</li>
            </ul>
