            <h2>Broad Overview</h2>
            <p>July 2018 is the 23rd month in which I have tracked my productivity. Overall productivity hours (especially software dev hours) for the month are fairly low, due in part to a week-long
             vacation at the start of the month. Nevertheless, I would say that I am a better programmer now than I was before, so progress has been made.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness: <strong>49.5</strong> hours</li> 
                <li>Software Development: <strong>22.25</strong> hours</li>
				<li>Music/Art: <strong>2</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Other: <strong>3.25</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Total productive hours: <strong>77.0</strong> hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My average amount of productive hours per day (from all categories) was <strong>2.48</strong> hours.</p>

			
            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>My software development goal for the month of July 2018 was to:</p>
            <ul>
				<li>Update EmojiPhoto with text-message sharing functionality</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p>That I succeeded in early on in the month. Actually, I took things just a bit further. I went ahead and implemented sharing via SMS, Gmail, and Whatsapp (along with Facebook and Twitter). You can find the Play
             store listing here: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ianterry.face">Emojiphoto on Google Play store.</a></p>		
			
			<p>For the remainder of the month I balanced time between working through problems on <a href="https://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a> and getting a head-start in my upcoming Data Structures and Algorithms class by 
			reading the first couple of relevant chapters in the textbook (I emailed my professor to ask what I should do to prepare). I also spent a lot of time this month researching/pondering what I want to do in the near
			 future as far as my education goes. I am still undecided, but I think there could be value in doing a masters thesis, which of course, would require me to enroll in an on-campus graduate program somewhere.  The main
			 issue here is money. No doubt, the online program I am in is more affordable (and also allows me to continue working full-time as long as I please). As of now, I am leaning toward staying on the track I currently am 
			 on and attempting to get accepted into Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. This is something I will have to keep thinking on.</p>			
							       			
            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <p>In July 2018, my overall fitness hours totalled to <strong>49.50</strong> hours. I spent <strong>16.00</strong> hours lifting weights, and I spent <strong>26.75</strong> hours running and cycling for
			cardio. My average lifting hours per week was <strong>3.61</strong> hours, and my average cardio hours per week was <strong>6.04</strong> hours.</p>
			
			<p>In the beginning week of July, I was on vacation, and so I pretty much ate a ton of junk food. I also did not stick to my plant-based diet. My first weigh-in for the month, when I got back home on July 8, was at 
			202.0 lbs (up more than 10 lbs since my June 30th weigh in)! Or course, a lot of that gain was water weight, and I was down to 196 by July 10. By the time July 31 rolled around, I was weighing in at 186.8 lbs. For 
			the record, this is the lowest I've weighed in about 10 years.<p>
			 
			<p>With the plant-based diet I have been on, it seems that I was easily able to get past my usual sticking point of 190. Keep in mind, at no point have I felt like I was leaving myself hungry. I am able to eat 
			enough good food to satisfy my hunger while still losing weight. Time will tell how much weight this diet will truly allow me to lose. Weight-loss is not my main reason for the dietary change, but I welcome it for now.</p> 
			  
			<p>As far as other benefits of the diet goes - my skin continues to look better than ever. I used to always have blackheads all over my face. I mean, I don't think it was particularly bad 
			or anything, but now I have next to zero blackheads. The skin on my face is almost like a child's. Also, my back does feel better overall, but I cannot definitively attribute this to my diet. 
			I have also started to stretch a lot (probably about 45 minutes every day), so that may very well have something to do with it.</p>
			
			<p>For the time being, I will be sticking to my plant-based diet. I have seen no negatives, so why would I stop?</p>
			
			<h2>Music/Art</h2>
			<p>I barely spent any time on music this month at all. Actually, for the time being, I think I would prefer to focus my efforts solely on software development. This category will probably be 
			removed for next month's post.</p>	 
			 	
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>In this past month, I spent <strong>3.25</strong> hours doing other productive stuff. Really, it's more than that. My consideration for what counts as productive hours in this category does not cover a lot of 
			actual productive activities like time spent researching grad schools or cleaning the kitchen, etc.</p>
			 		
			<h2>Books</h2>		 
			 <p>First up, I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79424.The_Way_of_the_Superior_Man"><u>The Way of the Superior Man</u></a> by David Deida. I rate it 3/5 stars. I considered giving it 
			 a 2/5, but there are two reasons why I settled on a 3. For one, while the book contains a lot of new age, spiritual mumbo-jumbo, there were some moments of keen insight that I do think I could take some value from. 
			 Secondly, reading this book influenced me to read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.</p>
			 
			 <p>As stated, the next book I read was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations"><u>Meditations</u></a> by Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor, and this 
			 book is a collection of stuff he wrote. As far as anyone knows, he never intended for this to be released as a book, and he never chose to title it "Meditations". The likely story seems to be 
			 that he was writing all of this just for himself. Who knows. Either way, this was a very influential read for me. In particular, I take these key lessons from the book:</p>
			 <ul>
				<li>If it is beyond your control, it does not harm you.</li>
				<li>You can control your perceptions.</li>
				<li>Be analytical/logical. Do not let emotions cloud your judgement.</li>
				<li>It is your duty to work diligently and to benefit the community.</li>
				<li>Pleasure-seeking is a vice and a weakness.</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>Marcus didn't necessarily say outright all of those things I mentioned, but that is my personal take-away from his writings. Here is one of my favorite verses from the book:</p>
			 <blockquote>“Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility to treat this person as he should be treated to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.”</blockquote>
			 
			 <p>As I mentioned, <u>Meditations</u> has had some influence on my life. I have, since finishing the book, been living a more ascetic lifestyle. What I mean by that is that I am 
			 abstaining from certain distractions/addictions: listening to music, watching youtube every time I eat, caffeine. I also have been taking cold showers instead of hot. Also, I think I 
			 have done a better job of staying focused at work. Another way that <u>Meditations</u> has influenced me: I feel a sense of duty in devoting myself to some purpose, so that I can maximize 
			 my personal contribution to the world. I am still searching for that purpose, which I would not define as a static thing; it could change over time. For now, I think that my purpose is in 
			 furthering my education and skills in the realm of computer science. I mean, that is what I've been doing anyway, but at least I feel more assured in that.</p>
			 
			 <p>Reading <u>Mediations</u> got me interested in philosophy, so I decided to read 
			 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100021.What_Does_It_All_Mean_A_Very_Short_Introduction_to_Philosophy"><u>What Does it all Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy</u></a>. Personally, I'd recommend 
			 skipping this one. The book gives short introductions to some of the main topics of philosophy, but it does not offer much insight. I just didn't get much value from this book. I rate it 2/5 stars.</p>
			 
			 <p>Next I will be reading <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic?from_search=true"><u>The Republic</u></a> by Plato. I am reading Allan Bloom's translation.</p>
