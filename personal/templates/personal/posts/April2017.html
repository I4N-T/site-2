            <p>Each Month, I make a post detailing what I’ve been working on, what I’ve accomplished, and just what I’ve been up to. This month's banner image features a sneak preview of my current work-in-progress, the Procedural World Generator.</p>
            <h2>Broad Overview</h2>
            <p>April 2017 is the eighth month in which I have tracked my productivity. I spent most of the month working on my procedural world generation project, and I spent one weekend creating a small game for Ludum Dare 38. Here is the breakdown of how I spent my time in April:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness: <strong>59.25</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Software Development: <strong>80.00</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Other: <strong>1.25</strong> hours</li>
                <li>Total productive hours: <strong>140.5</strong> hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My average amount of productive hours per day (from all categories) was <strong>4.53</strong> hours.</p>

            <p>April 2017 was by far my most productive month yet, beating out March 2017 by 32.5 hours. I am happy with the amount of work I have put in, although I still think I might could manage a bit more.</p>
            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>April 2017 was easily my most productive month for software development. The <strong>80</strong> hours I spent sharpening my software development and computer science skills over the past month make my previous best of 53 hours in January 2017 look downright pathetic.</p>

            <p>My overall software development goal for the month of April was to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work diligently on my project and have some real progress to show for it by the end of the month.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By my estimation, I have surely succeeded in that goal. I will need, at most, another week to tie up loose ends on my procedural world generator before I share it with the world; however, the project is mostly finished, and I am eager to move on to my next creation. I will have a more in-depth explanation of what I have created after it is finished (including a demonstration video), but for now I will offer a small blurb.</p>

            <p>The procedural world generator I have created allows you to procedurally generate a 2D tile map of a chosen size via use of any of 4 unique algorithms developed by yours truly. Each map will contain one dungeon, which can be clicked on to then procedurally generate a dungeon map.</p>

            <p>So that’s about as much detail as I want to go into for now on the Procedural World Generator. Let’s talk about what else I did this month.</p>

            <p>So, on a whim, I decided to create a game for Ludum Dare 38. If you don’t know what that is, Ludum Dare is the most famous game jam in the world. You can find more information <a href="https://ldjam.com/">HERE</a> on the official website. Basically, the gist of it is this: You get 48 hours to create a game based on a theme. The theme of Ludum Dare 38 was “A small world”.</p>

            <p>In a total of 11.75 hours, I created a game called World Under Siege, which you can play <a href="http://belowparallelstudios.com/WorldUnderSiegeGame/">HERE</a>. It is a simple little game, but I had fun making it. If nothing else, it’s one more complete project to add to my portfolio.

            <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/other/gameplay.png' %}" alt="Gameplay" width="800" height="600" /> <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/other/titleScreen.png' %}" alt="Title Screen" width="800" height="600" /> <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/other/gameover.png' %}" alt="Gameover" width="800" height="600" />

            <p>The game turned out pretty nicely I think, and it gave me the opportunity to quickly (and effectively) review some important concepts in Unity and game development as a whole. Be sure to check out some of the games other people created for Ludum Dare 38 <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/games">HERE</a>. It’s hard to believe some of them were made in less than 48 hours.</p>

            <p>So what’s next for me? Well, after I finish with the Procedural World Generator, I will be moving on to a very exciting and important project. I will be creating my own website from scratch using C# and ASP.net. What kind of site, you ask? A site much like this one. In fact, <strong>my goal for the month of May 2017 is to work diligently to create a personal portfolio website to replace BelowParallelStudios.com.</strong></p>

            <p>It is sad to say, but I think that this domain (BelowParallelStudios.com) has run its course. When I first started on this journey of hyper-productivity and personal development, my goal was mostly to learn to create games (or some other software products), and I figured that a brand name would be better for marketing as compared to just releasing things under my own name. By now, however, it is clear that this site is being used as a personal portfolio and journal, and so I think it would be best to just go ahead and make the site, domain and all, all about me.</p>

            <p>So, just to be clear, I will be building a new website, which will have a new domain name, but it will serve the same purpose as this site. I will continue to upload my monthly productivity reports, and I will continue to work hard to become the best version of myself that I can possibly be (this is important in case I ever run into any versions of myself from an alternate dimension).</p>
            <h1>Fitness</h1>
            <p>In April 2017, my overall fitness hours totalled to <strong>59.25</strong> hours, which makes April 2017 my most productive fitness month yet. I spent <strong>46.5</strong> hours lifting weights, and I spent <strong>12.75</strong> hours running and cycling for cardio. My average lifting hours per week was <strong>10.85</strong> hours, and my average cardio hours per week was <strong>2.98</strong> hours.</p>

            <p>My weight loss goal for March was to get below 205 lbs body weight. With an average weight last week of 203.8 lbs, I think it is safe to say that I succeeded in this goal. Here’s some data for you. First, a chart showing my weight on each day of the month:</p>

            <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/charts_and_graphs/April2017_bodyweight_daily.png' %}" alt="April Body Weight Daily" />

            <p>While there are some major fluctuations there, it is clear to see that the trend is steadily toward a lower weight. No, the weight loss this month was not dramatic, but I did lose a decent amount of weight. Let’s take a look at my average weight for each week of the month:</p>

            <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/charts_and_graphs/April2017_bodywieght_weekly.png' %}" />

            <p>Here, I think it is easier to see how much weight I lost. I went from an average weight of 206.3 lbs in the first week of April to an average weight of 203.8 lbs in the last week of April. That is a difference of 2.51 lbs. Not a lot, but I’ll take it. That amounts to about 0.63 lbs of weight loss each week.</p>

            <p>Now, here’s a chart plotting my weight on each and every day from March 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017:</p>

            <img class="img-responsive banner-img" src="{% static '/charts_and_graphs/2monthcombinedweightlossDAILY.png' %}" alt="Two month weight loss" />

            <p>In this context, my weight loss is starting to look sort of impressive.</p>

            <p>Aside from weight loss, it was a solid month for me in regards to strength as well. At the very least, I can say that I achieved my goal of maintaining my strength over the course of the month. I hit a new deadlift pr with 385 lbs for 5 sets of 3 reps, which is great. Unfortunately, I have stalled on my back squats lately. I think the problem is just that I go so hard on back days with deadlifts and rack pulls that I am never going into a leg day completely fresh. Soon, maybe starting in June, I will work out a new program, maybe with squats and deads on the same day. I’m not sure yet. We’ll see.</p>

            <p>My fitness goals for April 2017 will be to get below 200 lbs body weight while maintaining strength on all lifts.</p>
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>In this past month, I spent <strong>1.25</strong> hours doing other productive stuff.</p>
            <h2>Student Loan Repayment</h2>
            <p>Last month, my goal was to put <span style="color: #339966;">$1600</span> toward my debt. I fell short of my goal by $100.</p>

            <p>In the month of April 2017, I paid <span style="color: #339966;">$1500</span> toward my student loan debt, which currently rests at a total of <span style="color: #ff0000;">$26,309.62</span>. Since graduating in May of 2016, I have put <span style="color: #339966;">$17,350</span> toward my student loan debt. That means I have paid off <span style="color: #339966;">$15,383.30</span> of the original <span style="color: #ff0000;">$41,692.92</span> total. (For those wondering about how the numbers add up, keep in mind that some of the money I pay toward my debt goes to paying off interest).</p>

            <p>The reason I only paid off $1500 this month instead of my goal of $1600 is because I ended up needing to buy some new clothes due to having lost so much weight.</p>
            <h2>Goals for next month (April 2017):</h2>
            <h3>Software Dev Goals:</h3>
